As a quick helper, below are the equivalent commands from Maven to Gradle
(TESTING.md has also been updated). You can also run `./gradlew tasks` to see
all tasks that are available to run.
clean -> clean
test -> test
verify -> check
verify -Dskip.unit.tests -> integTest
package -DskipTests -> assemble
install -DskipTests -> publishToMavenLocal
