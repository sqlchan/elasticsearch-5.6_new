=== Java High Level REST Client

Starting from version 5.6.0 a new Java client has been released: the Java High Level REST Client.
This official high-level client (named like this to differentiate it from the existing low-level client) for
Elasticsearch can be used to execute search, index, delete, update and bulk operations using the same Core
Java classes as the `TransportClient` uses.

This Java High Level REST Client is designed to replace the `TransportClient` in a near future.

=== RPM and Debian packages `setgid` on `/etc/elasticsearch`

The RPM and Debian packages now set the `setgid` flag on `/etc/elasticsearch` so
that any files and subdirectories created under `/etc/elasticsearch` have the
same ownership as `/etc/elasticsearch` (`root:elasticsearch`). This is used to
ensure that files and subdirectories created under `/etc/elasticsearch` (e.g., a
keystore) are readable by the `elasticsearch` user.

=== Bootstrap checks now apply to link-local addresses

Previously when Elasticsearch was bound to localhost, Elasticsearch would bind
to any address on the loopback device. This included link-local addresses on the
loopback device such as `fe80::1%lo0` on macOS. Starting in 5.6.6, Elasticsearch
will now only bind to loopback addresses on the loopback device. Because of the
previous behavior, Elasticsearch would skip the bootstrap checks if bound to a
link-local address. Now that Elasticsearch no longer binds to such addresses
when binding to localhost, the bootstrap checks now apply to link-local
addresses.

=== Referencing Parent Documents

Previously in Elasticsearch parent documents could be aggregated on or 
referenced in a script using `_parent`. Now in order to reference a parent 
document in an aggregation or script you must do `_parent#my_parent` as stated 
in the <<mapping-parent-field,mapping a parent field documentation>>.
